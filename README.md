	1) check trunk socks
		1.1) if trunk is full, go to Logistics center
		1.2) if not, select branch to go
	2) Select branch according distance and stocks in branch factors
		2.1) if branch has stocks, go to next branch
		2.2) if hasn't stocks, choose the second another branch
	3) Enter branch and load cars in trunk
		3.1) if trunk if not full, load cars
			3.1.1) if trunk has place left, continue step 2)
			3.1.2) if trunk is full, finish collect process
		3.2) if trunk is full, finish collect process
	4) check time constrain and all stocks in all branches
		4.1) time not exceed and if has stocks left, do another tranport tour
		4.2) time not exceed and if has no stocks left, finish work today
		4.3) time exceed, finish work today
